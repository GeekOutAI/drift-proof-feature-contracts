# Contributing to Drift-Proof Feature Contracts

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Drift-Proof Feature Contracts**.

This project aims to establish a practical, open standard for defining, governing, and validating ML features through enforceable metadata contracts.

Contributions are welcome and encouraged.

---

## What This Project Is

This repository is a **reference standard**, not a product SDK.

It exists to:
- define best practices for Feature Contracts
- provide templates and examples
- document governance patterns
- evolve an open specification for drift-proof ML systems

The goal is clarity, consistency, and real-world applicability.

---

## How You Can Contribute

You can contribute in several ways:

### 1. Improve Templates
- Refine the Feature Contract templates
- Add new required or optional fields
- Clarify definitions or examples

### 2. Add Examples
- Provide realistic feature contract examples
- Cover different domains (finance, healthcare, retail, public sector)
- Demonstrate edge cases and advanced scenarios

### 3. Add Validation or Tooling
- CI validation patterns
- JSON Schema definitions
- GitHub Actions workflows
- Linting or drift-check utilities

### 4. Improve Documentation
- README enhancements
- Architecture diagrams
- Governance models
- Adoption guides

## Contribution Process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch from `main`
3. Make your changes
4. Submit a Pull Request
5. Include a clear description of:
   - what changed
   - why it improves the standard
   - any breaking implications

---

## Design Principles

All contributions should align with these principles:

- Features are governed products, not columns  
- Metadata is a first-class system component  
- Drift is prevented through contracts, not just monitored  
- Versioning is mandatory for semantic changes  
- Standards should be human-readable and machine-enforceable  

---

## What We Are Not Trying to Build

This is not:
- a feature store implementation
- a vendor-specific framework
- a proprietary toolchain
- a closed governance model

This is an open reference standard.

---

## Code Style & Format

- Use GitHub-flavored Markdown for documentation
- Use YAML for machine-readable contracts
- Keep examples realistic and enterprise-oriented
- Avoid toy datasets or academic abstractions

---

## Governance

The project is currently maintained by the original author.

As adoption grows, governance may evolve into a multi-maintainer or community-driven model.

---

## Final Note

If you're contributing here, you're not just improving a repo —  
you're helping define how modern ML systems **manage meaning at scale**.

Thank you for being part of it.
